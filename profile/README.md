## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The Tiny Toolkit is an organization for simple libraries. 

- The libraries are meant to be tiny, simple and easy to understand.
- The libraries will most likely only support a small set of features.
- The libraries will most likely be opinionated to keep them tiny and simple.

Feel free to fork any library and make it your own.
